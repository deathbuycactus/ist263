        I'm currently a full-time student at SU studying 
        information management and technology in the iSchool. 
        I'm proficient in Python and Java and I also have user 
        experience with Salesforce, Quickbooks, ADP, and Quickbase. 
        Currently, I'm looking for more experience in 
        IT management and IT consulting. Outside of work I'm a big video,
        board, and card gamer. Stuff I do outside the house almost 
        always pertains to arcades, physical sports - volleyball, basketball, etc,
        or finding the shadiest tree on an sunny day and a nice field on an overcast one.
