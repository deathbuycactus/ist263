                The Devil May Cry series features the titular pair of half demon twins, Vergil and Dante. They are each other’s fiercest rivals and greatest motivators. 
                “To see one’s justice through, a man must fight for it. Even if the one who stands before him is his kin. 
                The brothers of blood disagree on the very reason of their existence. They MUST fight.”
            </p>

                Dante was haunted by witnessing his mother’s violent death at the hands of demons, believing his brother was killed as well, 
                and being afraid of the demon inside him. Through this journey, he finally received the pushes he needed to accept himself 
                and use his power to the fullest to protect the human world he loves so dearly, even from his own brother; yet Dante’s power is personified with a vibrant red. <br><br>

                Vergil, who believed he was forsaken by his mother and brother when he fought off the demons that attacked him, 
                who believed his humanity was the reason he never could have and protect what he wanted, and believed demons 
                and the strength he inherited from his fully demon blooded father was the only truth worth pursuing; his power is steeped in blue and gray.<br><br>

                This characterization through color preys on our preexisting consumption of the standard good vs evil color themes where the villain is red and the hero is blue. 
                When you inspect the themes behind the narrative, Dante’s self acceptance journey centers around him accepting that he is part-demon, 
                that will never change, and it only works to his advantage so long as he uses his powers wisely, though demons are still perceived as evil, hence red. 
                Conversely, Vergil who fully embraces his demon side, rejects humanity, and walks the path of the lone demon soaked in blood, chaos, 
                and irreverence for the world he was born in, is given a blue theme. Another perspective the fans of the series have is that it makes perfect sense Dante is in a vibrant red being a passionate man who shows his love for others openly, 
                while Vergil is cold hearted and ruthless, but the moment he meets his son for the first time, he’s a stoic, but doting father, in his own twisted and somewhat violent way.
